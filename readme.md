### What I learned 

This was my first project and I really enjoyed myself. Centering the container horizontally and vertically on the page was challenging, but, eventually, it panned out. I also learned about HTML landmarks and their importance for well-designed websites. 

```css
.container-parent { 
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 95vh;
}
```
### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31217268/center-div-on-the-middle-of-screen) - This was helpful to understand better how vertical and horizontal alignment work.
